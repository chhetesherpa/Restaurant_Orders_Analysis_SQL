# Project Brief
This project aims to explore the key offerings of a hypothetical Restaurant called "Taste of the World Cafe", and its order history using SQL. 

The dataset comes from Maven Analytics' Guided Portfolio project titled "Restaurant Order Analysis". 

I assume the role of a Data Analyst at "Taste of the World Cafe" to answer a few critical questions that the restaurant is looking to get answers to. 

# CONTEXT 

The Taste of the World Cafe has recently started a new menu, and I have been asked to dig into its customer data to find which menu items are doing well and which ones are not. Further to that, I will also explore what the top customers seem to like best. 

# OBJECTIVES

Below are the main objectives of the project.
1. Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu.
2. Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been collected.
3. Finally, using the two tables ('menu_item' and 'order_details'), explore how customers are reacting to the new menu.
